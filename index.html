                    HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website. CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website. JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website. Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).

                    AI, ML, and DS are three interrelated fields in computer science and statistics. AI focuses on creating intelligent systems, ML enables computers to learn from data and make predictions, and DS leverages data to extract insights and drive decision-making. These three fields often overlap and complement each other in solving real-world problems and advancing technology.

                    Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI involves the development of an intelligent system that can perform the tasks that typically require human cognitive functions like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, building perception, and decision-making. Machine Learning (ML): ML is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems or machines to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Data Science (DS): Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines various techniques and methods from statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.
